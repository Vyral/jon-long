We’re heading into fall and we’re seeing more of the same from the real estate market. Over the last few months, we’ve had a market that’s sectioned off based on two specific factors: **Your location and price range.**

**Anything under $600,000 is still in a slight seller’s market.** These homes aren’t staying on the market for much longer than a month and we are still seeing multiple offers in some cases.

**Anything that’s priced from $600,000 to $750,000 is in more of a balanced market.** This is because this is where the affordability starts taking effect on first-time homebuyers.&nbsp;

In the $750,000 to $850,000 range, we’re shifting to more of a buyer's market. **If you’re a buyer, you can be a little bit more aggressive in your offers here.** Homes in this range are staying on the market for around 45 or 50 days.&nbsp;

In the luxury market of $850,000 and above, we have a much stronger buyer’s market and buyers have a lot more negotiation power. You’re probably starting to see on the news that there are some areas where we’re seeing depreciation here. Essentially, the higher the home is priced, the longer it’s going to sit on the market.

What does this mean for you? If you’re a buyer in that $600,000-and-below range, there is going to be plenty of competition for you. **The higher you go in price, the more power you have as a buyer.**

If you’re a seller, you should know that home values are staying pretty steady. What’s keeping them steady is interest rates, but we don’t know when those are going to go up. **Low interest rates give buyers more purchasing power and increase the pool of buyers that are looking at your home.**

If you have any other questions for me about the market or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
