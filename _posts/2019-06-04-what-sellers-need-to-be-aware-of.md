Before you put your home on the market, there are three things you need to be aware of if you want to sell quickly and for top dollar. &nbsp;

The first is **your competition.** In other words, be aware of the other properties on the market. If you have a 3-bedroom/2-bathroom home that’s 1,300 square feet and you want to list it at $600,000, how it compares to other homes with similar features in the same price range will make a difference in your success.&nbsp;

Second, **pay attention to the amount of inventory on the market.** Right now, homes under $600,000 average about two months on the market before they sell. When you get above $1 million, the average is closer to eight months.&nbsp;

Lastly, remember to **price your home according to your circumstances.** If you need to move quicker, for example, you need to be more aggressive in your pricing. As long as you price your home correctly in our market, you’ll have good results.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.
