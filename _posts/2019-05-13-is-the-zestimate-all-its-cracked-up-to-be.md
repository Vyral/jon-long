Can you trust Zillow’s Zestimates?&nbsp;

There are some upsides to the Zestimate feature: You can access it in the blink of an eye and you won’t have to input a ton of information. All in all, **the Zestimate tool is a great starting point for homeowners who want to get a general sense of their home’s value.&nbsp;**

For all the good, though, there’s some bad as well—**Zillow’s Zestimates can be off by as much as 8% to 10%**, and they say as much on their website. Seeing as a significant number of homes in our area fall into the $700,000 price range, a 10% miscalculation could amount to $70,000.&nbsp;

Zestimates are created through algorithms that rely on public data, such as MLS records, and they use that information to assess your home’s value based on comparable sales nearby.&nbsp;

**Where the Zestimate falls short, though, is in its assessment of certain features and updates that come with your home.** If you have a lot that’s 10,000 square feet, for example, the Zestimate will fail to take into account how much of that is usable. The age of your updates is a factor it will leave off the valuation as well—Was your home updated just a few years ago or was it done as far back as the 90s? &nbsp;

A real estate professional who works in your area will know it inside and out, and they’ll be more precise when evaluating your home than a Zestimate could ever be. **You’d be well-advised to reach out to an agent who serves buyers and sellers in your area because they’ll have exposure to the most up-to-date offers in your market.** That way, they can get you the best value for your home. &nbsp;&nbsp;
