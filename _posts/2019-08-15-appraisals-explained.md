Before you can buy or refinance a home, your lender will need to order an appraisal to verify the property’s value. Only once a home has been appraised at or near the value you plan to buy or refinance it for will your lender proceed with your loan. This helps to protect you, the buyer or homeowner, as well as the lender. Appraisals ensure that you aren’t paying more for a home than it’s worth, and that the lender isn’t doling out funds that outweigh the property’s actual value.&nbsp;

**To ensure unbiased results, the appraiser who evaluates the home will be selected from a pool of professionals by a third-party company.&nbsp;**

The appraiser will then follow guidelines from the bank to determine the property’s value based upon relevant, comparable properties in the area. This appraisal will generally cost between $550 to $600.&nbsp;

Unfortunately, because appraisers are only human, the process isn’t without its flaws. If the randomly selected appraiser assigned to your property doesn’t know the area well, the results of your appraisal could be flawed. An appraisal might also be skewed if the appraiser relies too heavily on a single comparable listing.&nbsp;

**Regardless of these potential pitfalls, though, an appraisal is still a necessary step in the real estate process.** Even sellers should consider ordering one before listing their home on the market. This way, they can be sure that no issues related to financing will arise once they’ve gone under contract with an interested buyer. However, it’s important to realize that the value this pre-listing appraisal assigns to your home won’t necessarily be the price you sell for. It’s simply a good ballpark figure to keep in mind.&nbsp;

**Unlike an appraiser, your agent sees what’s going on in the market every single day.** In addition to just looking at comparable homes, high-quality Realtors also keep tabs on current trends. Agents understand that these things also play a role in your home’s value. We keep in mind what the average buyer would be willing to pay for your home, as well.&nbsp;
