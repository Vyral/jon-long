How can you find the right listing agent to represent you during your home sale? There are four tips you can follow to ensure you’re partnering with the best possible professional:&nbsp;

**1\. Work with an agent you trust.** Your listing agent is going to play a major role in your success, so choosing someone you know you can rely on is essential. If you don’t feel comfortable during your listing appointment, you may want to keep looking.&nbsp;

**2\. Work with an agent who has a lot of experience.** It’s one thing to have been in the business for years on end, and it’s another to have a long track record to show that this time was well spent. Of course, a lengthy career is a good sign, but make sure that the person you choose has also sold a lot of homes throughout their time as an agent, as well. Agents should, on average, sell at least one home a month (or 12 homes a year).&nbsp;

**3\. Work with an agent who has great communication skills.** Real estate transactions are complex, so it’s critical that you work with someone who can explain what’s happening and keep you in-the-loop every step of the way. Poor communication from an agent is frustrating at best, and could ruin your deal at worst.&nbsp;

**4\. Work with an agent whose results are worth their commission fee.** As the saying goes, “You get what you pay for.” This is certainly true in real estate. When it comes time to sell your home, your focus should always be on your bottom line. You might need to pay slightly more money to hire a high-quality agent, but you can be sure that partnering with this kind of professional will bring you more money at the end of the deal.&nbsp;
