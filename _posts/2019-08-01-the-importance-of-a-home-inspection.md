Home inspections are an essential step in the real estate process, but why is this the case? We’ll explain in a moment, but let’s first cover what a home inspection is.

**A home inspection is a process during which a professional inspector visits a listing to make sure that all of its major structural, mechanical, and safety-related features are in good shape.** The inspector will look into every nook and cranny and record any problems they find.&nbsp;

A general home inspection will cost about $500 on average, but specialized inspections can be ordered for an additional fee.&nbsp;

Buyers will generally order an inspection during their due diligence period once they’ve gone under contract on a home, but **sellers may also find it beneficial to order their own inspection before the property hits the market.** Doing so will alert them to any problems that need to be resolved before their home goes live.<br>&nbsp;

A pre-listing inspection can also help you determine a fair price for your property, based on its condition.&nbsp;

And, as we mentioned earlier, buyers also benefit from the home inspection process. First of all, it gives them peace of mind. **Buyers can feel much more comfortable investing their hard-earned money into a home if they know exactly what kind of shape it’s in.** Just because a seller has lived in a home, that doesn’t mean they’re aware of everything that could be wrong with it. Many problems, big or small, aren’t apparent to the naked eye—it takes a professional inspection to really get to the bottom of things.

Of course, if an issue is uncovered, buyers shouldn’t turn their nose up at the home just yet. Buyers and sellers have the chance to negotiate repairs once the inspection is complete. The seller can either resolve problems on their own or give the buyer a credit so that they can take care of it at their leisure. If it comes down to it, though, buyers can walk away if the problem is too great or a compromise can be reached.&nbsp;

Whatever their outcome, home inspections are essential.&nbsp;
